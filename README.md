# [Erugo](https://na4n.github.io/erugo) 
Erugo is a rogue-like game made in JS that ~~runs in modern web browsers~~ at least works locally (and may work for you).

# To Do
- Add non-traditional mob movement
- Add clmbat mechanics
- more interesting dungeons
- colored entities
- css, night/light theme corner
- hall of fame
- refactor code
	- simplified dungeon initialization (async)
	- consistent getplayer and getfloor
	- main.js, player.js, dungeon.js
