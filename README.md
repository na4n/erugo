# [Erugo](https://na4n.github.io/erugo) 
Erugo is a dungeon crawler that runs in the browser and is written in Javascript.
Features a gauntlet of 10 levels, randomly generated, with trainable character attributes. 

# Why
I mean why not.

I grew up (mostly) without modern consoles and the earliest gaming experience I had besides my Wii (Wii Sports/Resort) was emulating old consoles on my Toshiba Chromebook 2. Playing Rogue on DOSbox and Legend of Zelda Minish Cap on VisualBoyAdvance made me a lifelong RPG lover, and to get back to my roots (and learn Javascript) I made Erugo.

# Things that need implementing
1. modules (Entity Manager)
2. separate concerns in dungeon.js
3. comments
4. reduce DOM manipulation
5. lint 

---
1. reimplement themes
2. simplify init, single call, reorganize setup
3. refactor *dungeon.js*
    - *dungeonRefresh()* logic
4. recactor *main.js*
    - reimplement major functions: *logMsg()*, *reset()*, *save()*
5. refactor *player.js*
    - decide implementation of *getPlayer()*
