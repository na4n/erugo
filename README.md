# [Erugo](https://na4n.github.io/erugo) 
Erugo is a rogue-like game made in JS that ~~runs in modern web browsers~~ at least works locally (and may work for you).

# To Do
- Add mob movement (and turns)
- refactor code
	- consistent getplayer and getfloor
	- spaghetti code (event listeners for training)
