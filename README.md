# [Erugo](https://na4n.github.io/erugo) 
Erugo is a rogue-like game made in JS that ~~runs in modern web browsers~~ at least works locally (and may work for you).

# To Do
make dungeon.js better (everything)
- combat mechanics
- trainer functionality (s/d only?)
 
- Killing entity only shows when arrow key pressed (reproduce, cornered + attack multiple)

- seed based randomization
- more interesting dungeons
- colored entities
- hall of fame
